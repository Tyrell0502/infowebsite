        <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>
        <article class="browser">
          <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
          <p>Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox. It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, where it is the default browser. Chrome initially used the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages. In 2013, they forked the WebCore component to create their own layout engine Blink. Based on WebKit, Blink only uses WebKit's "WebCore" components, while substituting other components, such as its own multi-process architecture, in place of WebKit's native implementation. On January 11, 2011, the Chrome product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome would remove H.264 video codec support for its HTML5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more in line with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on.</p>

          <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
          <p>Firefox was created in 2002 under the code name "Phoenix" by the Mozilla community members who desired a standalone browser, rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle. During its beta phase, it proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's then-dominant Internet Explorer 6. As of July 2022, according to StatCounter, it has 7.8% usage share as a desktop web browser, making it the fourth-most popular desktop web browser after Google Chrome.</p>

          <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
          <p>Microsoft announced the public release of the new Edge on January 15, 2020. In May 2022, according to StatCounter, Microsoft Edge became the second most popular desktop browser in the world, overtaking Apple's Safari. (Both browsers are still very close in usage, with Safari ahead on weekends. Microsoft initially announced that Edge would support the legacy MSHTML (Trident) browser engine for backwards compatibility, but later said that, due to "strong feedback," Edge would use a new engine, while Internet Explorer would continue to provide the legacy engine. Edge integrates with Microsoft's online platforms to provide voice control, search functionality, and dynamic information related to searches within the address bar.</p>

        <h1 class="programmingLangauges">Most Popular Programming Langauges</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="javascriptInfo">JavaScript is a programming language often abbreviated JS and is one of the core technologies for the world wide web. Alongside HTML, and CSS Javascript is used to create dynamic webpages to upload to the web. There are many libraries and frameworks that can be used to have better access to the power Javascript has. 
           JavaScript is a high level, often compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype based object orentation, and first class functions.
            It is multi paradigm, supporting event driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has applications programming interfaces for working with different parts of the web through an interface that is loaded into your project.
            JavaScript engines were originally used in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and different
            and differ greatly in design. In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997. JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.
            For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p class="pythonInfo">Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured object oriented and functional programming.
           Python is dynamically typeed and garbage collected. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontied with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
           Til this day, Python ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

        <h2>C#</h2>
        <p class="csharpInfo"> C sharp is another object oriented language that can be used to make web apps on any computer. It is a general purpose multi paradigm programming language. C sharp (C#) encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declaritive, functional, generic, object oriented, and component oriented programming disciplines. The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejisberg from Microsoft in 200 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma in 2002.
            A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code, and the unified .Net platform, all of which support C# and are free, open source, and cross platform.
